### Objective

The assignment focuses on the application of advanced statistical methods to predict the time-to-failure of aircraft engines and classify their operational status, using a dataset that simulates a run-to-failure scenario. The report includes a comparative study between the two techniques: regression and classification, employed for the predictive maintenance of the aircraft engines from the provided data. The studyâ€™s outcome is expected to contribute significantly to the field of predictive maintenance by providing insights into the effective use of regression and classification techniques in real-world scenarios.
